Hi, I'm Evelyn, welcome to my personal page! I'm a second-year PhD student in the department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering (ISE) of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I'm actively seeking an advisor.

My current research interests broadly lie in Machine Learning, and more specifically, on theoretically uncovering the mysterious underlying connection of the modern model properties (i.e, transferability, robustness, regularization, etc); I'm also open to the neighbour areas, including but not only the robustness of federated reinforcement learning, efficient algorithms for seeking equlibriums of federared learning game, etc.
