Hi, I'm Evelyn, a second-year PhD student in the department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering (ISE) of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). 

I'm currently interested in Machine Learning, and more specifically on theoretically uncovering the mysterious underlying connection of model properties (i.e, model transferability, robustness, regularization, etc); I'm also open to the neighbour areas, including but not only the robustness of federated reinforcement learning, efficient algorithms for seeking equlibriums of federared learning game, etc.
